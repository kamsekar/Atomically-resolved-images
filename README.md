# Atomically-resolved-images
Code for image analysis of atomically resolved electron micrographs.

This repository contains code, written in the scope of my master's thesis, and the thesis itself. The thesis was a part of a Master's degree in Physics, awarded by the University of Ljubljana. 

The work encompasses several preprocessing routines, determination of atomic column positions, segmentation of images into structurally different parts, and alignment of identical location images. The implementations largely follow ideas from the cited references.
